    <p>Spider-Man's greatest battle has always been within himself: the struggle between the everyday Peter Parker and the heavy responsibility that rests on Spider-Man's shoulders. But now Peter Parker is faced with a much bigger conflict: Electro, an enemy with far greater powers than himself. And when his old friend Harry Osborn returns, Peter realizes that all his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp. Can Spider-Man protect New Yorkers from the evil that threatens the city?</p>
